### Summary: ### 
I am currently working primary school teacher. A year ago, I’ve decided to change my career. I started learning HTML and CSS with htmlAcademy courses. In February, 2019 I got to know about RSS School and new resource for me – CodeAcademy. I went through HTML and CSS courses there. From 16th of September I’ll start studying at the Caspian University, Almaty, Computer Science faculty. This will be my second Bachelor Degree. I’ll finish in 2021.
I am self-motivated and self-educating person. I obtain new skills quickly. Though it took some time to understand coding process.  I am interested in applying everything I've learned so far. I found it exciting and challenging. 
My aim is to become a professional front-end developer. I know it is possible.
