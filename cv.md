### Summary: ### 
I am currently working primary school teacher. I've decided to change my professional career.  
So I've started to learn HTML, CSS and JS. I am self-motivated and self-educating person. I obtain new skills quickly.  
And I am interested in applying everything I've learned so far. I started my jorney of coding with HTML-academy online courses.  
I found it exiting and challenging. Then I got to know about the RSS-school and Codeacademy. Now I study there.  
And it's even more interesting. I am a realistic person. Taking to account my experience as a frontend developer  
(includes tasks from the HTMLAcademy and CodeAcademy only) I understand my chances.   
Nevertheless, I am an optimistic person too. So, I am here.
